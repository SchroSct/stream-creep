A set of scripts for downloading the live streams of several sites, myfreecams.com, streamate.com (under several names), and chaturbate.com.

Set the models you want to follow in creep-start.bash, with the corresponding script for the site they are on.

Run rtmprec.bash in a directory to catch the files.

Later run rtmpconvert.bash in the same directory to convert these to playable videos.

Run one script per user per model to prevent firefox from being difficult.  ie, user1, user2, user3, user4 to follow 4 models.


sm-creep.bash = streamate.com creep script.
mfc-creep.bash = myfreecams.com creep script.
chat-creep.bash = chaturbate.com creep script.
